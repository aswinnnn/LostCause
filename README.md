![What you'll see when you open the game](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/672628098931490847/990602105603645460/lostcus_3.png)



# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
- installed via `git clone`
- coming soon on `pip`
```
git clone https://github.com/aswinnnn/LostCause.git
```
- go to `LostCause` folder and:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
the game will not work without the dependencies! If you cannot run the above command, open requirements.txt and `pip install` the dependencies yourself.



# üïπÔ∏è Play
- Go to the destination folder on your command line.
- run `game.py` in `Python`. requires `3.10` or higher
```
py game.py
```
or
```
python game.py
```
```
python3 game.py
```


# üì¶ Dependencies
- LostCause uses the following external dependencies:
```
rich=12.4.4
```
LostCause heavily utilises `rich` for its intuitive and easy to use UI in the CLI. Without `rich` the program won't be expected to work.

# üì∞ Citations

- Look at [citations](citations.md) for resources I cited during the development of the game.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
```
This game was designed to be minimally educational and informative and should not be considered academically relevant. Though I've utilised a number of papers for it, it still shouldn't be considered anything more than a product for a hackathon.
Do look at citations.md to see the resources I used while creating the project.
```
